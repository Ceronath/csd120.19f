            <h1>Welcome to Jordan Poulin's CSD120 Website!</h1>
            <p>
             I'm currently a first year Computer Programmer student at Sault College in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The majority of
             my IT experience is in hardware. I'm an avid gamer and enjoy building PCs and figuring out how computer components work.
             My goal in taking this course is to expand my knowledge out of hardware and more into software development and other forms
             of programming, such as web development, as well as pursue a career in this field.
           </p>
           <p>In my spare time I like to relax and spend time with my family. I play a good amount of games on my PC, but I try not to
             spend too much time playing them nowadays.
