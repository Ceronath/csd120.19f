    <h1>Welcome to Jordan Poulin's CSD120 Website!</h1>
        <p>
        I'm currently a first year Computer Programmer student at Sault College in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The majority of <br>
        my IT experience is in hardware. I'm an avid gamer and enjoy building PCs and figuring out how computer components work. <br>
        My goal in taking this course is to expand my knowledge out of hardware and more into software development and other forms <br>
        of programming, such as web development, as well as pursue a career in this field.                                       <br>
                                                                                                                                 <br>
        In my spare time I like to relax and spend time with my family. I play a good amount of games on my PC, but I try not to <br>
        spend too much time playing them nowadays. 
        </p>
